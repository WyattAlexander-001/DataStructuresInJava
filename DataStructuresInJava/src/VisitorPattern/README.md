## Pattern to add more operations to objects WITHOUT modding them. 
* The key terms in GOF are:
    * Elements: Interface/Examples
    * Visitors: Interface/Examples
## An Element
* These are the OBJECTS which operation will be performed on, they ACCEPT a VISITOR

## A Visitor
* These are the OBJECTS that PERFORM the operation ON the ELEMENT
